Simple Tooling
==============

In this series we are going to build on top of the runbooks we built on :doc:`the previous section <../simple_runbooks/index>` and build more versatile tooling. Most tools will be not that very different from its equivalent runbook so you should be able to look at them side by side and realize how easy it was to build a cli tool from a previous runbook thanks to the fact that brigade is a native python framework and integrates natively with other frameworks like `click <http://click.pocoo.org>`.
