From Runbooks to Advanced Tooling
=================================

In this section we are going to build advanced tooling in a series of baby steps. We will start writing very simple runbooks, then we will slightly rewrite those runbooks to turn them into flexible cli tools. Once we are done with that we will turn those isolated cli tools into an advanced tool that can accommodate different workflows.
