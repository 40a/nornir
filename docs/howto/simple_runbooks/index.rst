Simple Runbooks
===============

In this series we are going to build a few simple runbooks to do various tasks on the network. Each runbook is going to do one specific tasks and is going to make certain assumptions to simplify the logic as possible; like which devices are involved, where is the data located, etc. In following series we will build on these runbooks to build more flexible and complex tooling.
